# Week 3 Lab

Topic: Basic process, key/framework, incremental goals, code, test and debug
 
Learning Material:
1. Lab 3
2. Module 4 pre-class activities
Lab: Working in small groups, apply the basic processes to solve a set of
problems, then code them individually.

The process:

1. Work out the incremental goals

2. Work out a plan for each goal (what patterns + steps will you use?)

3. Write your code incrementally

4. Devise test cases

5. Debug

Note: This lab exercise requires you to do your own testing. Consider the edge and middle cases across all dimensions/axes and write down your test cases. In these exercises, we do NOT require you to test for invalid input.
