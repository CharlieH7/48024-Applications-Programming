# How To Run App

This assignment uses javafx combined with a MVC architecture to create a graphical user interface for a tuition management system (TMS) 
It has the functions of:
- Adding new student
- Removing existing student
- Selecting a particular student to view their personal details and tuition details
- Retrieve tuition slip from a selected student
- Retrieve report from the whole student group
- Search filters work asynchronously with non-case sensitive partial matching function. Either name filer works, or email filter works, not both.

Intent: This programming assignment provides practice and tests for the topics of system design, GUIs and
MVC.

1. Launch TMXfx.jar in \dist\TMXfx.jar

2. Log in to the TMS system using the credentials stored in TMSfx/src/model/Faculties.java (inside the Faculties() constructor)

3. Read Assignment 2 Specifications TMSfx.pdf on how to use the system
